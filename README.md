My journey of learning all the cool stuff in CS  



For all the ones out there:

Yoyoyo, whatsup! This place will become the life book of my jounrey of learning CS, I will regularly write down the interesting stuff I've learned and share some of my thoughts and experiences during this process. 

Year past a year, day past a day, we all know we will reach there, it is just a matter of time. 

I believe with patience and persistence, time will fly me to my destination.
